# Image-Processor
Overlays images and banners onto input images

## Setup instructions
Download zip file from [this link](https://github.com/jezgillen/Image-Processor/archive/master.zip "Image Processor.zip"). 
Unzip file, to find the Image Processor executable and three folders.
The images to be processed can be put in the 'input' folder, 
the banner image should be put in the 'top' folder, 
and the logos to be placed at the bottom of the input should go in the 'bottom' folder.
There are example images already in these folders to test the program on.

Double click the Image Processor executable to run the program, 
which will create an output directory containing processed images.

The first time the program is run, a Windows Defender popup will stop it from running, due to it being an unrecognised program. Click 'More info' and then click 'Run anyway'. Only ever bypass Windows Defender if you trust the source of the program.
